# Glass or Table Classifier Web App
This example takes a model created in one of our earlier [Transfer Learning](https://github.com/am1tyadav/Computer-Vision-with-Convolutional-Neural-Networks/blob/master/02%20-%20Transfer%20Learning.ipynb) experiments. We created a model which uses ResNet50 as its first layer and a dense layer with 2 nodes as the output layer. This new model was then trained to distinguish between images of glasses and tables. The dataset used is Glasses vs Tables by [Muhammed Buyukkinaci](https://github.com/MuhammedBuyukkinaci).

## Deploying a Keras Model
Much of the code remained exactly the same as the Jupyter Notebook linked above. We create a Keras model with the same architecture (ResNet50 with pretrained weights as first layer and a Dense layer with 2 nodes as output). We load the saved weights. Just like in the notebook, we use the image preprocessing from Keras to create a function that will prepare incoming images to be fed into our trained model. Since we are loading pre-trained weights, we do not need to perform any training again.

## Flask App
If the request method to the homepage is GET, we display a file upload form. When an image file is uploaded, it is saved to the `static` folder, is prepared to be fed into our model to make a prediction and ultimately a prediction is made using `model.predict`. This value is returned and displayed on the web page along with the uploaded image.
